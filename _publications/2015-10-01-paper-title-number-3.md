**Abstract:** Next generation tissue-engineered skin scaffolds promise to provide sensory restoration through electrical stimulation in addition to effectively rebuilding and repairing skin. The integration of real-time monitoring of the injury motion activities can fundamentally improve the therapeutic efficacy by providing detailed data to guide the clinical practice. Herein, a mechanically-flexible, electroactive, and self-healable hydrogels (MESGel) was engineered for the combinational function of electrically-stimulated accelerated wound healing and motion sensing. MESGel shows outstanding biocompatibility and multifunctional therapeutic properties including flexibility, self-healing characteristics, biodegradability, and bioelectroactivity. Moreover, MESGel shows its potential of being a novel flexible electronic skin sensor to record the injury motion activities. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo experiments prove that MESGel can facilitate effective electrical stimulation, actively promoting proliferation in Chinese hamster lung epithelial cells and therefore can accelerate favorable epithelial biology during skin wound healing, demonstrating an effective therapeutic strategy for a full-thickness skin defect model and leading to new-type flexible bioelectronics.
