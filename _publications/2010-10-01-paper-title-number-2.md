Since the 2010s, the demand for healthcare models has exceeded the prevailing resources available due to the rapid increase in the aging population in China. However, a significant gap in development of biomedical materials remains, especially between China and the western developed countries. Collagen is the major protein of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and has been extensively applied in medical fields. Collagen-based biomaterials (CBBs) are used to prepare dressings and dermal substitutes, surgical sutures, plasma substitutes, tissue-engineered scaffolds, and drug delivery systems; this is attributed to their exceptional biocompatibility, biodegradability, hypoimmunogenicity, and coordination between collagen hosts and tissues. This review provides thorough strides in CBB structures, crosslinking and forming technologies, and real-world applications. First, the natural origin and specific structures of animal-derived collagen and non-animal-derived collagen are introduced and compared. Second, crosslinking methods and forming technologies of CBBs across the board are discussed. Third, several examples are considered to demonstrate the practical biomedical use of CBBs and highlight cautionary notes. Finally, the underlying development directions of CBBs from an interdisciplinary perspective are outlined. This review aims to provide comprehensive mechanisms by which collagen can be uniquely and practically used as advanced biomaterial, hence providing options for augmenting its development in China.
